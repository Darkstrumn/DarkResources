DarkTechSystems - includes resouce library
The SDK directory has templates for most file types used in making skins.
The includes are the progenitors of the templates, but should flow similarly, and should be looked upon as
example code. The can be referenced from the consumer of the includes.

Note:
Dark-CommonLibrary.inc is a lua code file. The .inc naming convention was given the .lua code meant to be included
by another script.
- This may change as it was also given to .ini meant to be included by other skin components
  (I know, it was an oversight...really!).
